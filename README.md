##  Installation

### Install via npm

```sh
npm install trydivjs --save-dev
```

---

##  Getting Started

After installing `trydivJS`, it will automatically create a `utils/` directory in your project root and a `script.js` file inside. This makes integration and component management seamless.

### Import and Use Components

```javascript
// utils/script.js
import { DivUi } from "trydivjs";

const divUi = new DivUi();

// Load a UI component
divUi.GetComponent("your_component");
```

Replace `your_component` with the desired component name, then run the script to fetch it.

### Running the Script

Execute the following command to generate the component file:

```sh
node utils/script.js
```

This will create a **`your_component`** file inside the `utils/` folder, which you can use in your project.

### Adding Multiple Components

Simply add multiple lines to fetch additional components:

```javascript
// give a try to these components:-
divUi.GetComponent("Slider04");

divUi.GetComponent("Navbar03");

divUi.GetComponent("Card03");
```
