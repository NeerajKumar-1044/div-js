##  Getting Started

Once you install `trydivJS` library, it will automatically create a folder `utils` in your root directory and a script.js file inside utils folder. just add **`ONE LINE`** of code and use any component you want.

```javascript
// utils/script.js
import { DivUi } from "trydivjs";

const divUi = new DivUi();

// Fetch a UI component
divUi.GetComponent("your_component");
```

Simply replace `your_component` with the desired component name, rerun your script.js, and let **DivJS** handle the rest!

```javascript
// Button component
divUi.GetComponent("Button01");

// Navbar component
divUi.GetComponent("Navbar01");

// Login page component
divUi.GetComponent("Login01");

More components are available, and new ones are added regularly!
